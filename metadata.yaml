description: The basic premise in this antidance treatise is typical of this genre
  of dance literature; namely, dance is bad for the health and is a waste of money.
  The author utilizes a novel approach and uses trees as metaphors to support his
  arguments. Some trees are "not comely to look upon, but the fruit very good." Other
  trees have dangerous fruit, and the author concludes that samples of the fruit found
  on the tree of dancing include "pride, lasciviousness, lying, drunkenness, embezzlement,
  fornication, cruelty, idolatry, prostitution, abortion, and assassination." The
  manual was reissued in 1886 as The upas tree.
